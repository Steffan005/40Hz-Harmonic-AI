Orchestrator receives request\n2. Orchestrator delegates task to Office\n3. Office executes task using Tools\n4. Office returns result to Orchestrator\n5. Orchestrator synthesizes result\n\nCode Structure:\n\n* orchestrator.py: Orchestrator logic\n* office.py: Office logic\n* tools.py: Tool logic\n\nPermission Model:\n\n* Software Engineer: Full file system access\n* Law offices: Read-only except for their document directory\n* Crypto offices: No file system, only market data APIs\n\nSecurity Considerations:\n\n* Access control: Offices can only access authorized tools and data\n* Data encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
